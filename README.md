# CS300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The purpose of the projects was to use a data structure to load, sort, and display course information for ABCU 
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached it by picking the data structure that I thought would work best, I initially thought that the hash table made the most sense to use in the project but then realized it did not make the most sense.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When I realized that the data structure I selected was not the most efficient and useful one, I chose binary tree/vector which made more sense in how this project needed to be completed.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It has taught the use of algorithms, which is not something I had experience in previously. When using algorithms, you look at programs differently. It allows a more incremental approach to the development.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has made me grow exponentially as a programmer by teaching me the hard way how to write reliable code that is adaptable and maintainable.
